# GEMINI.md - Spec-Driven Development with AI

This repository is designed for Spec-Driven Development (SDD), where AI agents are guided by precise specifications and architectural intent to generate code.

## Workflow with AI Agents (e.g., Gemini CLI)

The intended workflow for evolving this project involves a series of `/sp.*` commands. Each command serves a specific purpose in the SDD lifecycle:

1.  **`/sp.constitution`**: Defines the project's core principles, vision, and constraints.
2.  **`/sp.specify`**: Creates or updates a detailed feature specification in Markdown.
3.  **`/sp.plan`**: Generates a technical implementation plan based on the specification and constitution.
4.  **`/sp.tasks`**: Breaks down the implementation plan into a granular, dependency-ordered list of tasks.
5.  **`/sp.clarify`**: Identifies and resolves ambiguities in the specification or plan through targeted questions.
6.  **`/sp.implement`**: Executes the implementation plan by generating and modifying code files according to the task list.

## Important Notes for AI Collaboration

-   **All code changes in the `src/` directory MUST be generated by an AI agent (e.g., Gemini).** Manual edits to implementation code for this hackathon are discouraged as they bypass the SDD process.
-   The AI agent will adhere strictly to the generated `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` documents.
-   To progress through the development phases, use the `/sp.*` commands sequentially.
