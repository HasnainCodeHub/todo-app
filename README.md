# Todo In-Memory Python Console Application (Phase I)

This is Phase I of "The Evolution of Todo" project, implementing a simple command-line Todo application. All tasks are stored in memory and are lost when the application exits.

## Features

- Add Task
- List Tasks
- Update Task
- Delete Task
- Mark Task Complete / Incomplete

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+

## Phase I – Running the App

1.  **Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed.**
    You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Navigate to the project root directory** (the folder containing `src/`).

3.  **Run the application using the Python module execution command:**
    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```
    This is the recommended way to run the application to ensure Python correctly resolves all internal package imports.
    (Note: Running `python src/main.py` directly from within the `src/` directory is not recommended and may lead to import errors.)
